/*
 * ImplicitlyWait is a global wait.It is a built-in automatic wait.
 * 
 * It will be applied on all the web elements by default.
 * 
 * If an implicit wait is set, the driver will wait for the duration of the provided value before returning an error.
 * 
 * This is a global setting that applies to every element location call for the entire session. The default value is 0, which means that if the element
 * is not found, it will immediately return an error. If an implicit wait is set, the driver will wait for the duration of the provided value before 
 * returning the error. Note that as soon as the element is located, the driver will return the element reference and the code will continue executing, 
 * so a larger implicit wait value wonâ€™t necessarily increase the duration of the session.
 * 
 * Do not mix implicit and explicit waits. Doing so can cause unpredictable wait times. For example, setting an implicit wait of 10 seconds and an 
 * explicit wait of 15 seconds could cause a timeout to occur after 20 seconds.
